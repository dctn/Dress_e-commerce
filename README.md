A polished, production-ready Django application built as a demonstration of a full-stack e-commerce experience, tailored for dresses but easily adaptable to other product types. This project can be used as a portfolio piece, showcasing backend API design, frontend user flows, third-party integration, and deployment practices.

## 🔍 Overview

The system supports:

- **Dynamic product catalog** with categories and filters.
- **Persistent shopping cart** with quantity adjustments.
- **Multi-step checkout** including shipping address, order review, and payment.
- **Payment gateway integration** using Razorpay (configurable for others).
- **User management**: registration, login, password recovery, email/phone verification.
- **Order tracking** and history for customers.
- **Admin panel** for content management and order processing.

This repository is intentionally modular; each Django app encapsulates a specific domain (core, cart, payment), enabling reuse or extraction in other projects.

## ⚙️ Technologies & Dependencies

- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, Django 4.x
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL/MySQL recommended for production

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

Automated tests ensure stability and regressions are caught early.

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Tests cover models, views, and form logic. Additional linters (flake8, black) can be run if desired.

---

## 📦 Deployment Guidelines

1. **Select a host** (Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean, etc.).
2. **Use a production database** (PostgreSQL recommended).
3. **Collect static files**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py collectstatic
   ```
4. **Configure WSGI** via Gunicorn:
   ```bash
   gunicorn e_commerce_site.wsgi:application
   ```
5. **Set environment variables** securely (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False, payment keys).
6. **Serve static/media** with Nginx or your hosting provider’s mechanisms.

A `Procfile` is included for Heroku deployment.
